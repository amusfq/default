# Default

A starting points for certain projects.

## Getting started

Here’s where you write really fantastic instructions that helps people who may or may not even understand what Git is, use your project. For example, your sentences should probably be better than that one.

```bash
npm install -g harp
harp init -b kennethormandy/default
```

This prevents the Git history from being downloaded. And, hey, now you have [Harp](http://harpjs.com) installed, which is awesome anyway. If you want to go the Git route:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kennethormandy/default new-project-name
cd project-name
# Please be careful…
rm -rf .git
```

1. Replace “Default” and “default” with your new repository’s name
2. Replace references to “kennethormandy” and my email with your details (unless you are me—which you probably are)
3. Make sure you’re onboard with what’s in [the contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)
4. Fill out the rest of the [`package.json`](package.json)
5. As appropriate, add your company to the copyright statement below in [the license](LICENSE.md):

    ```markdown
    Copyright © 2014 [Kenneth Ormandy](http://kennethormandy.com) & [Chloi Inc.](http://chloi.io)
    ```

6. Initialise and add remotes:

    ```sh
    # Initialise the project
    git init

    # Add your remote repository
    git remote add origin https://github.com/kennethormandy/default
    ```

## Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing! There’s information about how to [get started with Default here](CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you’re new to all this GitHub, Open Source, JavaScript, Node.js, testing, wow all this stuff seems really difficult I just want to make my sites better stuff, I get it. I’m still there, too.

Feel free to [send me an email](hello@kennethormandy.com) or [open an issue here](http://github.com/kennethormandy/default/issues) and I’ll do my best to share some resources that have helped me out. No promises—I’m still learning, too—but I can say it would be great to have you stay around, or be involved in any capacity, if you’re interested.
